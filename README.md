This is a prototype of my solution to the Inversity Challenge: "Burgers to broccoli? How can technology help us eat healthier and live longer?".
The problem I've chosen to tackle is that people don't have the motivation to eat a healthy diet, and my solution is an app which allows users to take a picture of their meal, which would then be sent to an image recognition model to identify each type of food they’ve eaten, and calculate the portions. There would be a character whose mood changes depending on how healthy the user’s diet is recently. This would help solve the problem of motivation as it presents everything in an informal way, making it more understandable, and also takes advantage of people naturally wanting the character to be happy.
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the prototype is a website instead of a fully developed app. The picture taking and image recognition feature is replaced by the user manually entering portion sizes instead, but there are guildlines provided to help them. However, other than that, the basic functions of the website and the app are the same, and changes (such as including the character), can be made easily, and image recognition can also be implemented once a model has been trained.
